1. JSX ?
    - JSX is not html
    - JSX is like html but not html
    - JSX also keep the security -> cross scripting
    
2. - js engin is not understanding jsx.
    - js engin will understand ES6 (ECMA Script)
    - all react code is coded in jsx   
    - the jsx code is transplied by using parcel
        - parcel is like manager and it handles multiple libraries so this 
          jsx code conversion is done by babbel. (actually babbel is transpiling code)
        - means jsx code is converted into browser understanding language.
        - Actully the jsx code is transpiled before it reaches the JS engin
        - Babbel transpiles the code as per the browser version
        - JSX code ==> babble transpiles it in React.createElement() ==> ReactElement - JS Object ==> HTMLElement(render) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        - Babbel read each and every character < h > H e l l o < / h > one by one
        - () use if we are writting jsx in multiple line

3. What is component?
    - Class based component
        - uses class
    - Functional based component
        - uses Function

4. React functional component   
    - A function that returns JSX code that is react functional components
    - Also note that when before returning the JSX code it is converted into the language that JS engin 
      understand.

1. npm?
    -npm is package manager (IMP^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^)
--> full form 
    -> npm does not have full form
    - It manages node packages so we say it as a node package manager
    - It is the biggers package manager
    - all the packages are hosted in npm (axios, mongodb, react-router-dom)
    
2. package.json
    - configuration for npm 
    - why we need
        - It handles the packages and there specific versions as per the project
          requirment.

3. what is bundler?
    - webpack, parcel, vite these are bundlers and etc...
    - bundler is used to bundle the whole project before sending it to the production.
    - react itself uses webpack and bubble to build things

4. npm i -D parcel?
    - what is -D?
        - Dev dependancies is used when we are in development phase.
    -npm i parcel
        - this is normal installation.

5. "parcel": "^2.13.3" --> ^ <-- what is this?
    - ^ this is keret
        - parcel will automatically update if new minor version comes.
        - basically it will install the latest minor version 
        - eg.
            - 2.13.3 --> 2.13.4
 
6. "parcel": "~2.13.3" --> ~ <-- what is this?
    - ~ this is tilde
    - this tilde will automatically update if the major update
    - eg.
        - 2.13.3 --> 3.0.0

7. package-lock.json?
    - It tracks the exact version of all the dependancies 

8. node-modules
    - node-modules basically fetches all the data or code of all the dependancies 
      init.
    - node-modules is just like database of dependancies
    - eg.
        - we install parcel but the parcel also needs different
          dependancies to run so that dependancies are also installed. 
          may be that dependancies that requires to run parcel may also needs 
          another dependancies so it will install that as well. 
            - this is knows as transitive dependancies (IMP^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^)
    
    - Basically parcel need libraries means it requires dependancies to run 
      so it will install required dependancies.

9. npx parcel index.html
    - npx means executing package
    - difference between npx and npm 

10. Parcel 
    - development Build mode (Dev Build)
        npx i -D parcel
    - Local server 
        - http://localhost:1234
    - HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
        - when we save file and automatically page refreshes this all happens
          and you see changes in html file on browser. 
          because of HMR
    - File Waching Algorithm    
        - Written in C++
    - Caching - Faster Builds
        - Parcel do this caching in .parcel-cache
    - Image Optimazation
    - Minification of file
    - Bundaling
    - Compressing
        - Minify your code
    - Consistent Hashing (Read it)
    - Code Splitting
    - Differential Bundling - support older browser
    - Supports localhost
    - Diagnostic
    - HTTPs
    - Error Handling
    - Tree Shaking Algorithm
        - Will remove unused code 
    - different dev and production bubble
